# Image Segmentation Pipeline Optimization Using Q-learning

## Project Overview

This project utilizes **Q-learning**, a type of reinforcement learning, to optimize the preprocessing pipeline for image segmentation tasks. The goal is to dynamically select and fine-tune different preprocessing techniques (such as filtering, contrast enhancement, and thresholding) to achieve the best performance in segmenting images. The Q-learning agent explores different pipeline configurations and evaluates their effectiveness in order to find the most optimal one for image segmentation.

## Key Features

- **Reinforcement Learning**: Using Q-learning to optimize the image segmentation pipeline.
- **Modular Preprocessing Pipeline**: Includes various image processing techniques such as filtering, contrast adjustment, and thresholding.
- **Dynamic Pipeline Optimization**: The system dynamically adjusts the pipeline configuration based on the Q-learning agent's actions and rewards.
- **Segmentation Models**: Implements different image segmentation models to evaluate the performance of each pipeline.
